## COVID-19 Case Trend at a University

### Scenario
University campuses around the world experienced a major shock in 2020 amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. During the academic year of 2021-2022, many universities across the country began a soft return to campus. To obey with the county Public Health reccomendations, a university in Southern California tracked the COVID-19 cases between students, employees and contractors on and off campus. This data was utilized to determine staffing for the contact tracing team and the testing tent team and update university COVID-19 protocol.

### Dataset
The data was reported weekly by contact tracers on campus between 8/3/22 to 6/27/22. 
* Reliability: the data incliudes case count data for 47 weeks that was collected by contact tracers on campus. 
* Original: the data was collected first hand through incident repoorts submitted by students, employees, and contractors. 
* Comprehensive: the data only includes count of cases among students, employees and contractors but not identifying information. 
* Current: the data analyzed was current since it was updated weekly throughout the school year. 
* Cited: the data was collected first hand by the university

‚ùå Data limitations
* Since the data was collected from incident reports submitted by students, employees and contractors, there is a great chnace that many cases were not added to the count since they were not reported. 
* The data excludes characteristic information, therefore analysis on the data is limited.

* Student cases on campus decreased when students were on break while employee cases on campus remained the same. 
* Case counts were thee highest during January, which led the university to postppone the return of students to campus during the Spring semester.
